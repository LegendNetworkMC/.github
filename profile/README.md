# Legend Network
Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Legend Network! Here you can find various open-source projects as well as multiple roadmaps for our network. We are strong advocates for open-source software and try our best to open-source as many tools and libraries as we can.

## Who are we?
Legend Network is a name that has been around for some time. There have been multiple iterations growing from ideas, to a Clan, and finally to a Server. In each iteration, we have learned and developed new skills as a team and organization. In this most recent iteration, we are looking to become even bigger than ever and grow into a network with multiple servers and games.

## What do we do?
We are a group of developers, designers, and content creators who are passionate about creating an enjoyable experience for our players. We are always looking for new ways to improve our network and are always open to new ideas and suggestions. Here in the developer world, we strive to push the boundaries of what can be done in Minecraft.

## What are we working on?
Currently, Legend Network is in its Alpha stage. We are working on creating a fun and unique Practice server. However, we already have some plans for what we want to see done after our initial release. These plans include more games, stronger infrastructure, custom and unique twists to the game itself, and more!

## Interested?
We are always looking for new people to join our team and expand our network. If you are interested in playing or joining the team, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/legendnetwork).
